# Calculator Project
To create this project, I converted a provided flowchart into a working Python program. The program first greets the user, and then prompts the user to select from the following range of operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentation, and square roots. The calculator restarts the selections after an operation is completed, and offers the user an option to quit the program. 

**Special Notes**: This program assumes integer input and guides the user to prevent exceptions not handled (ie. division by zero during the division operation).
