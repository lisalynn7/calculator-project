# Calculator Project
To create this project, I converted a provided flowchart into a working Python program, with some additional features and added functionality. The program first greets the user by name, and then prompts the user to select from the following selection of operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentation, and square roots. The calculator restarts the calculator after an operation is completed, and offers the user an option to quit the program. 

**Special Notes**: This program assumes integer input and guides the user to prevent exceptions not handled (ie. division by zero during the division operation).
